			<h3>What is an outage?</h3>
      <h4>Planned Outage</h4>
      <p>A planned outage occurs when the customer decides in advance to stop
      running the turbine in order to perform regular service. </p>
      <p>Because planned outages are coordinated in advance between the customer and AGS Turbine
      Services, the customer can plan around power generation needs (demand
      is usually lowest in the fall/spring) and AGS can plan for labor and tool costs.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Unplanned Outage</h4>
      <p>
        An unplanned outage occurs when a turbine stops operating unexpectedly.
        Because this is unplanned, it costs more for the AGS team to plan the labor
        and tool costs to support the customer during this outage.
        </p>

			<h3>What is a service-level agreement?</h3>
			<p>A <strong>service-level agreement (SLA) </strong>outlines the duration, cost, and terms
      of service that AGS Turbine Services will provide to the customer for
      a specific product. </p>
      <p>The agreement can include upgrades, parts, maintenance
      & repairs, training, as well as installation and commissioning of new turbines.
      The SLA details the scope and frequency of this service, and usually includes
      support if a turbine experiences an outage.
        </p>

<h3>About us</h3>
<p>One of the more profitable trends in energy generation is not simply the sale of turbines, but continuous service contrct.</p>
<p>
  AGS's current strategy is to <strong>maintain a strong customer focus as a way to continue selling both tidal turbines and service contracts.</strong>
